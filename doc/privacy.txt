== Privacy =========================================================

    As of version 2.4.5, when kRO mirror support was introduced, the
patcher has to contact the home website to retrieve information
about currently available mirrors and mirrored files. These are
retrieved over an unsecured HTTP connection.

    As of version 2.0.0, the patcher supports automated checking for
new versions, initially opt-in, as of version 2.4.5 as always on,
and as of version 2.4.7 as opt-out with UI settings and ability to
check for new versions manually. The information is retrieved over
an unsecured HTTP connection.

    As part of it's core functionality, the patcher communicates
with the designated official web and patch server to retrieve patch
information and files respectively. The communication happens over
unsecured HTTP and FTP connections.

    During the communication listed above, following information is
disclosed as part of the protocol traffic:

- HTTP:
    - Public IP address of the source (implied).
    - RO Patcher Lite version and ipatch configuration name (explicit, user-agent string).
    - Windows* version and platform (explicit, user-agent string).
- FTP:
    - Public IP address of the source (implied).

    Explicitly disclosed information is used for statistical purpose
as aid for further development of the application. Collected data is
not used to identify or contact an individual.

    Custom and legacy pure builds may have further implications on
privacy, as available in their respective privacy policies, if
available.
